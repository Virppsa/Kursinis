	abstract = {Skin cancer is a major global public health concern. Early diagnosis of skin cancer is essential for better patient outcomes and lower mortality rates. Artificial intelligence ({AI}) has the potential to increase the precision of skin cancer prediction and help doctors with diagnosis. This short communication reviews the recent advances and future directions in {AI}-powered skin cancer prediction. A comprehensive assessment of the literature is conducted to evaluate papers published between 2016 and 2022. The proposed research methodology explored Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science databases to identify relevant studies according to proposed research questions. A total of 780 studies were found, of which 62 were from Scopus and 20 were from Web of Science These studies were selected for study as per the research question constraints. The study examined how well {AI} could distinguish between benign and malignant lesions and diagnose skin cancer, including melanoma and non- melanoma skin cancers. The analysis showed that deep learning algorithms showed good rates of sensitivity and specificity in predicting skin cancer, suggesting that they could be a useful tool for dermatologists. However, the small sample sizes and lack of real-world testing limited the generalizability of these findings. Additional research is needed to assess how well {AI} works on people with various skin tones under different environmental conditions. Future research should also focus on developing {AI} algorithms that can be used to diagnose other types of skin cancer, such as basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.},

	abstract = {Predicting the time, location and magnitude of an earthquake is a challenging job as an earthquake does not show specific patterns resulting in inaccurate predictions. Techniques based on Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) are well known for their capability to find hidden patterns in data. In the case of earthquake prediction, these models also produce a promising outcome. This work systematically explores the contributions made to date in earthquake prediction using {AI}-based techniques. A total of 84 scientific research papers, which reported the use of {AI}-based techniques in earthquake prediction, have been selected from different academic databases. These studies include a range of {AI} techniques including rule-based methods, shallow machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Covering all existing {AI}-based techniques in earthquake prediction, this article provides an account of the available methodologies and a comparative analysis of their performances. The performance comparison has been reported from the perspective of used datasets and evaluation metrics. Furthermore, using comparative analysis of performances the paper aims to facilitate the selection of appropriate techniques for earthquake prediction. Towards the end, it outlines some open challenges and potential research directions in the field.},

	abstract = {We present a novel method for coastal tsunami prediction utilizing a denoising autoencoder ({DAE}) model, one of the deep learning algorithms. Our study focuses on the Tohoku coast, Japan, where dense offshore bottom pressure gauges ({OBPGs}), called S-net, are installed. To train the model, we generated 800 hypothetical tsunami scenarios by employing stochastic earthquake models (M7.0–8.8). We used synthetic tsunami waveforms at 44 {OBPGs} as input and the waveforms at four coastal tide gauges as output. Subsequently, we evaluated the model’s performance using 200 additional hypothetical and two real tsunami events: the 2016 Fukushima earthquake and 2022 Tonga volcanic tsunamis. Our {DAE} model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting coastal tsunami waveforms for hypothetical events, achieving an impressive quality index of approximately 90\%. Furthermore, it accurately forecasted the maximum amplitude of the 2016 Fukushima tsunami, achieving a quality index of 91.4\% at 15 min after the earthquake. However, the prediction of coastal waveforms for the 2022 Tonga volcanic tsunami was not satisfactory. We also assessed the impact of the forecast time window and found that it had limited effects on forecast accuracy. This suggests that our method is suitable for providing rapid forecasts soon after an earthquake occurs. Our research is the first application of an artificial neural network to tsunami prediction using real observations. In the future, we will use more tsunami scenarios for model training to enhance its robustness for different types of tsunamis.},

	shorttitle = {A Tale of Tails},
	abstract = {As {AI} model size grows, neural scaling laws have become a crucial tool to predict the improvements of large models when increasing capacity and the size of original (human or natural) training data. Yet, the widespread use of popular models means that the ecosystem of online data and text will co-evolve to progressively contain increased amounts of synthesized data. In this paper we ask: How will the scaling laws change in the inevitable regime where synthetic data makes its way into the training corpus? Will future models, still improve, or be doomed to degenerate up to total (model) collapse? We develop a theoretical framework of model collapse through the lens of scaling laws. We discover a wide range of decay phenomena, analyzing loss of scaling, shifted scaling with number of generations, the ''un-learning" of skills, and grokking when mixing human and synthesized data. Our theory is validated by large-scale experiments with a transformer on an arithmetic task and text generation using the large language model Llama2.},

	abstract = {Recent progress in hardware and methodology for training neural networks has ushered in a new generation of large networks trained on abundant data. These models have obtained notable gains in accuracy across many {NLP} tasks. However, these accuracy improvements depend on the availability of exceptionally large computational resources that necessitate similarly substantial energy consumption. As a result these models are costly to train and develop, both financially, due to the cost of hardware and electricity or cloud compute time, and environmentally, due to the carbon footprint required to fuel modern tensor processing hardware. In this paper we bring this issue to the attention of {NLP} researchers by quantifying the approximate financial and environmental costs of training a variety of recently successful neural network models for {NLP}. Based on these findings, we propose actionable recommendations to reduce costs and improve equity in {NLP} research and practice.},

	abstract = {In the era of proliferation of large language and image generation models, the phenomenon of "model collapse" refers to the situation whereby as a model is trained recursively on data generated from previous generations of itself over time, its performance degrades until the model eventually becomes completely useless, i.e the model collapses. In this work, we study this phenomenon in the setting of high-dimensional regression and obtain analytic formulae which quantitatively outline this phenomenon in a broad range of regimes. In the special case of polynomial decaying spectral and source conditions, we obtain modified scaling laws which exhibit new crossover phenomena from fast to slow rates. We also propose a simple strategy based on adaptive regularization to mitigate model collapse. Our theoretical results are validated with experiments.},
